            The <b>Internet</b> is a global system of interconnected computer networks that use the 
standard Internet protocol suite(TCP/IP) to link several billion devices worldwide. It is a <i style="color: red;">network of 
    networks</i> that consists of millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks 
of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking 
technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such 
as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web(WWW), 
the infrastructure to support email, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing and telephony.

            The origins of the Internet date back to research commissioned by the United States 
            government in the 1960s to build robust, fault-tolerant communication via computer 
            networks.[2] This work, combined with work in the United Kingdom and France, led to the primary 
            precursor network, the ARPANET, in the United States. A 1980 paper refers to "the ARPA 
            internet". <span style="color: red;">The interconnection of regional academic networks in the 1980s marks the beginning of 
            the transition to the modern Internet. </span>From the early 1990s, the network experienced sustained 
            exponential growth as generations of institutional, personal, and mobile computers were 
            connected to it.
