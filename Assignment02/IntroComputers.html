        <h2>History of Computers</h2>
        <p>The history of computers goes back <b>over 200 years.</b>
        At first theorized by mathematicians and entrepreneurs, during the 19th century mechanical calculating machines were designed and built to solve the increasingly complex number-crunching challenges. 
        The advancement of technology enabled ever more-complex computers by <span style="color: aqua;">the early 20th century</span>, and computers became larger and more powerful.</p>

        <p>Englishman,Charles Babbage,invneted in the 1830's a "Difference Engine"made out of brass and pewter rods
            and gears,and also designed a further device which he called an "Analytical Engine".His design contained the five key characteristics of modern computer.

        <p>Augusta Ada Byron<i>(later Counters of Lovelave)</i>was an associate of Babbage who has become known as the first computer programmer.</p>

        <h2>Computer Parts</h2>
        <h3>Central Processing Unit</h3>
        <p>A <b>central processing unit (CPU)</b>, also called a central processor, main processor, or just processor, is the most important processor in a given computer.[1][2] 
            Its electronic circuitry executes instructions of a computer program, such as arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations.
            This role contrasts with that of external components, such as main memory and I/O circuitry,
            and specialized coprocessors such as graphics processing units (GPUs).</p>

        <p>Keyboard keys (buttons) typically have a set of characters engraved or printed on them, and each press of a key typically corresponds to a single written symbol. However, producing some symbols may require pressing and holding several keys simultaneously or in sequence.[3] While most keys produce characters<img src="./img_source/Snipaste_2024-08-03_13-54-04.jpg" alt="Keyborad" width="150px" height="60px" style="float:right;"> (letters, numbers or symbols), other keys (such as the escape key) can prompt the computer to execute system commands. In a modern computer,
        the interpretation of key presses is generally left to the software: the information sent to the computer, the scan code, tells it only which physical key (or keys) was pressed or released.[4]In normal usage, the keyboard is used as a text entry interface for typing text, numbers, and symbols into application software such as a word processor, web browser or social media app. Touchscreens use virtual keyboards.</p>
